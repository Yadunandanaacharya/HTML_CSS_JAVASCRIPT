/* Using Javascript Objects
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
 we access the data in objects through what are called properties.
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
 you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". 
However, you can also use numbers as properties.

Follow these test cases
myDog should contain the property name and it should be a string.
Passed
myDog should contain the property legs and it should be a number.
Passed
myDog should contain the property tails and it should be a number.
Passed
myDog should contain the property friends and it should be an array.
Passed
myDog should only contain all the given properties.*/

var myDog = {

"name" :'Sham',
"legs" :4,
"tails":1,
"friends" :['Manu','Raju']


};
